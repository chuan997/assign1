By contrast, the frequencies of those social noise complaints are much higher on weekends.*\n\n### **About monthly pattern:** *The \"Heat/hot water\" shows a special trend that in winter from November to March, the frequency of this complaint type is extremly high, however, in summer only few of this complaint.
